Please do following  to test the app -

- Clone the repo on your local m/c. branch main.
- move into the cloned directory.
- npm install
- npm start.

Please note following -

- Code compiles and shows shoping list for mobile and desktop.
- CSS is not 100% optimised as we noticed not smooth transition and table rows gets out of order if we resize.
- did not test for unit test and accessibility but can be done in next version.
- works great for iPhone-SE to iPhone 14 pro max.
- for iPad mini it doesn;t work as i limit transition for 768px and that is iPad mini;s width is. Sure we can modify it.
- for iPad Air and Max it shows table view.. I think we can make changes and make it card view but its not major issue.
